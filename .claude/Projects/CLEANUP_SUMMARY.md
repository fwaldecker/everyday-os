# Everyday-OS Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up and optimized the everyday-os repository by removing unused services, consolidating configuration, and implementing automatic n8n workflow deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Services
- **Supabase**: Removed all components, configuration, and environment variables
- **SearXNG**: Removed service, configuration, and all related files

### 2. Configuration Cleanup
- **`.env.example`**: Reorganized into clear sections with helpful comments
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Removed unused services and volumes
- **`Caddyfile`**: Removed routing for deleted services

### 3. N8N Workflow Automation
- Consolidated 18 workflows into single `/n8n-workflows` directory
- Implemented automatic workflow import on first run
- Created `import-n8n-workflows.sh` helper script
- Uses marker file to prevent duplicate imports

### 4. Repository Structure
- Deleted empty directories: `/supabase`, `/searxng`, `/docker/searxng`
- Removed redundant `/docker/n8n/backup` directory
- Cleaned up old workflow directories

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with n8n workflow section
- Removed all references to deleted services
- Simplified setup instructions in SETUP_CHECKLIST.md

## Benefits Achieved
