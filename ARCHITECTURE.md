## Overview

Everyday-OS is a self-hosted platform that combines multiple services into a cohesive system for content creation, automation, and social media management. The architecture uses Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containerized services behind a Caddy reverse proxy.

### Core Philosophy
- **Single Configuration**: One `.env` file controls everything
- **Persistent Data**: Named Docker volumes ensure data survives updates
- **Service Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container
- **Unified Access**: Caddy provides SSL and routes all services through subdomains

---

## Why This Architecture?

### 1. **Docker Compose Orchestration**
- **Why**: Manages complex multi-service dependencies with a single command
- **Benefit**: `docker-compose up -d` starts everything in the correct order
- **Alternative considered**: Kubernetes (too complex for small deployments)

### 2. **Service Separation**
- **Why**: Each service has different requirements and update cycles
- **Benefit**: Can update n8n without touching Mixpost, etc.
- **Trade-off**: More complexity vs monolithic application

### 3. **Two Database Systems**
- **PostgreSQL**: Required by n8n for workflow storage
- **MySQL**: Required by Mixpost (Laravel default)
- **Why not one?**: Each app is optimized for its specific database

---

## Service Breakdown

### Essential Services

#### 1. **PostgreSQL** (Database for n8n)
```yaml
Purpose: Stores n8n workflows, credentials, execution history
Why needed: n8n requires PostgreSQL for production deployments
Data volume: postgres_data
```

#### 2. **n8n** (Workflow Automation)
```yaml
Purpose: Visual workflow automation, API integrations
Special configs:
  - 5GB buffer settings for large file handling
  - Persistent storage in n8n_storage volume
  - Workflows imported from n8n-workflows/ directory
Why critical: Core automation engine for the platform
```

#### 3. **MySQL** (Database for Mixpost)
```yaml
Purpose: Stores Mixpost data (posts, accounts, schedules)
Why separate: Laravel/Mixpost optimized for MySQL
Data volume: mysql_data
```

#### 4. **Mixpost** (Social Media Management)
```yaml
Purpose: Schedule and manage social media posts
Complexity factors:
  - Commercial Laravel application
  - Requires license key
  - Custom AI comment features added
  - Must overlay custom code on vendor image
```

#### 5. **Valkey/Redis** (Cache Layer)
```yaml
Purpose: Caching for both n8n and Mixpost
Why needed: Improves performance, required by Laravel
Data volume: valkey_data
```

#### 6. **MinIO** (Object Storage)
```yaml
Purpose: S3-compatible storage for files
Used by: NCA Toolkit for video processing
Why needed: Provides unified storage API
Data volume: minio_data
```

#### 7. **NCA Toolkit** (Media Processing)
```yaml
Purpose: Video captioning, document processing
Custom features:
  - CRF video quality settings
  - Custom video processing parameters
Why included: Specialized media processing capabilities
```

#### 8. **Caddy** (Reverse Proxy)
```yaml
Purpose: SSL termination, routing, security headers
Features:
  - Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
  - Security headers (XSS, CSRF protection)
  - 5GB buffer for n8n file uploads
  - Custom CSP policies for each service
```

## The Mixpost Challenge

### Why Mixpost is Complex

1. **Commercial Software**
   - Distributed as Docker image from `inovector/mixpost-pro-team:latest`
   - Requires valid license key
   - Cannot modify base image directly

2. **Your Customizations**
   - Added AI comment generation features
   - OpenAI/Anthropic integration for social media
   - Custom routes and controllers
   - Modified service providers

3. **Laravel Structure Requirements**
   ```
   vendor/inovector/mixpost/
   ├── src/           <- Your AI service modifications
   ├── routes/        <- Custom API endpoints
   ├── resources/     <- UI modifications
   └── config/        <- Configuration overrides
   ```

### Current Implementation

The `packages/mixpost-custom/` directory exists because:
1. You need to track your customizations in Git
2. These files must overlay the vendor files at build time
3. Laravel expects specific directory structures

### The Build Process
```dockerfile
# Start with their image
FROM inovector/mixpost-pro-team:latest

# Overlay your customizations
COPY packages/mixpost-custom/src /var/www/html/vendor/inovector/mixpost/src
COPY packages/mixpost-custom/routes /var/www/html/vendor/inovector/mixpost/routes
# ... etc
```

## File Structure Explanation

### Current Structure
```
everyday-os/
├── .env                          # Single configuration file
├── .env.example                  # Template for new installations
├── docker-compose.yml            # Service orchestration
├── Caddyfile                    # Reverse proxy configuration
│
├── docker/                      # Docker-specific files
│   ├── mixpost/
│   │   └── Dockerfile          # Builds Mixpost with customizations
│   └── nca-toolkit/            # NCA Toolkit application

└── CLAUDE.md                   # AI assistant instructions
```

### Why Each Directory Exists

- **docker/**: Keeps Docker-specific files organized
- **packages/**: Separates custom code from configuration
- **n8n-workflows/**: Version control for automations

## GitHub Distribution Strategy

### Goal
Allow clients to deploy your entire setup with:
1. Clone from GitHub
2. Add their Mixpost license key
3. Configure domain and passwords
4. Run one command

### Challenges

1. **License Keys**
   - Cannot commit Mixpost license to GitHub
   - Solution: Use `.env.example` with placeholder

2. **Custom Code**
   - Your Mixpost modifications must be included
   - Solution: Build process applies them at runtime

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Passwords, API keys must not be in GitHub
   - Solution: Generate on first run or require in `.env`

### Proposed Solution

#### Option 1: Single Setup Script
```bash
# User runs:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/everyday-os
cd everyday-os
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with their details
./setup.sh  # Does everything
```

#### Option 2: Docker Compose Build
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml includes:
mixpost:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: docker/mixpost/Dockerfile
```
This builds Mixpost with customizations automatically

#### Option 3: Simplified Structure
Move Mixpost customizations into Docker build context:
```
docker/mixpost/
├── Dockerfile
├── customizations/
│   ├── ai-comment-controller.php
│   ├── routes.php
│   └── ... (only changed files)
```

---

## Setup Flow

### First-Time Installation

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # User edits .env with:
   # - BASE_DOMAIN
   # - MIXPOST_LICENSE_KEY
   # - Passwords
   ```

2. **Docker Images**
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull  # Gets base images
   docker-compose build # Builds custom images
   ```

3. **Service Initialization**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres mysql
   # Wait for databases
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Data Import**
   ```bash
   # n8n workflows imported automatically via volume mount
   # MinIO buckets created on first start
   ```

5. **Verification**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   # Access services at their domains
   ```

---

## Simplification Options

### Option A: Minimal Mixpost Integration
**Approach**: Include only the modified files, not entire package structure

```
docker/mixpost-custom/
├── AIController.php
├── OpenAIService.php
└── routes-addon.php
```

**Pros**: 
- Fewer files in repo
- Cleaner structure

**Cons**: 
- Harder to track what was modified
- Build process more complex

### Option B: Mixpost as Submodule
**Approach**: Keep mixpost-custom as Git submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/youruser/mixpost-custom packages/mixpost-custom
```

**Pros**: 
- Separate version control
- Can update independently

**Cons**: 
- Submodules are complex
- Extra step for users

### Option C: Build-Time Fetch
**Approach**: Download customizations during build

```dockerfile
RUN curl -L https://github.com/youruser/mixpost-custom/archive/main.tar.gz | tar xz
```

**Pros**: 
- Minimal files in main repo
- Can update customizations separately

**Cons**: 
- Requires internet during build
- Another dependency

### Option D: Separate Mixpost Completely
**Approach**: Run vanilla Mixpost, use n8n for AI features

**Pros**: 
- Simplest setup
- No customization complexity

**Cons**: 
- Lose integrated AI comments
- More complex workflows

## Recommendation

### For GitHub Distribution

1. **Keep current structure** but document it well
2. **Use .env.example** with clear placeholders
3. **Create comprehensive setup script** that:
   - Validates requirements
   - Checks configuration
   - Builds custom images
   - Initializes services
   - Imports data

4. **Document for two audiences**:
   - **End Users**: Simple setup instructions
   - **Developers**: How to modify customizations

### Setup Instructions for Users

```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Get the code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/everyday-os
   cd everyday-os
   ```

2. **Configure**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Add your domain and Mixpost license
   ```

3. **Install**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. **Access your services**
   - n8n: https://n8n.yourdomain.com
   - Mixpost: https://social.yourdomain.com
   - MinIO: https://minio-console.yourdomain.com
   - NCA: https://nca.yourdomain.com
```

---

## Why Not Simpler?

### The Reality of Modern Web Apps

1. **Different Tech Stacks**
   - n8n: Node.js
   - Mixpost: PHP/Laravel
   - NCA Toolkit: Python
   - Each has optimal database/cache requirements

2. **Commercial Software Constraints**
   - Mixpost license requirements
   - Cannot redistribute their code
   - Must overlay customizations

3. **Enterprise Features You Added**
   - AI integration requires API keys
   - Video processing needs storage
   - Large file handling needs special configs

### The Trade-off

**Complexity now** = **Power and flexibility later**

You could simplify by:
- Removing services (lose functionality)
- Using SaaS alternatives (monthly costs)
- Building monolithic app (massive development effort)

But the current architecture gives you:
- Full control
- No recurring costs (except Mixpost license)
- Ability to customize everything
- Enterprise-grade capabilities

## Next Steps

### To Achieve Your Goal

1. **Clean up unnecessary files**
   - Remove backup directories
   - Delete unused scripts
   - Consolidate Docker files

2. **Create foolproof setup**
   - Single setup.sh script
   - Automatic validation
   - Clear error messages

3. **Documentation**
   - User quickstart guide
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Customization guide

4. **GitHub Repository Structure**
   ```
   README.md           # Quick start
   INSTALL.md          # Detailed setup
   CUSTOMIZE.md        # How to modify
   ARCHITECTURE.md     # This document
   .env.example        # Configuration template
   setup.sh            # One-command setup
   docker-compose.yml  # Service definitions
   Caddyfile          # Routing rules
   ```

This architecture isn't accidentally complex - it's deliberately comprehensive. Each piece serves a specific purpose in creating a powerful, self-hosted platform that rivals expensive SaaS solutions.
